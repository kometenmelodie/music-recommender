Spotify data set with 1.2 million songs with features such as danceability,
energy, key, acousticness, etc.

The data set was reduced to two dimensions using an unsupervised UMAP.
This embedding is the backbone for the `TrackRecommender`. The inner workings
of the recommender are pretty simple. Based on an input song, the track 
with the lowest euclidian distance to the input is found. The distance is 
calculated using the embedding.
Here's a small example on how to use the `TrackRecommender`:

````python
from recommender import TrackRecommender

rec = TrackRecommender()

# get the Spotify id for Fleetwood Mac's - The Chain 
the_chain = rec.resolve_song_name_to_id(song_name="The Chain - 2004 Remaster")

# >>> the_chain
# '5e9TFTbltYBg2xThimr0rU'

# get a recommendation
rec_track = rec.recommend(song_id=the_chain)

# >>> rec_track
# {
#     "id": "4o6yLK8SOQ2RdfosVaaBBv",
#     "name": "Let's Eat",
#     "album": "A Certain Distance",
#     "artists": "['Dave Nachmanoff']",
# }
````
